(no functional changes since 0.9.0)

  and `java.util.ArrayList`)
#15: ClassMate jar should include LICENSE file

0.8.0:

* Combine various ResolvedType.resolve(...) methods, using `java.lang.reflect.Type`
  as common super type
* Changed order arguments for "resolve" that takes TypeBindings and Type, to prevent
  problems with overloading: now TypeBindings is the first argument, not second

  of Class<?>, GenericType and ResolvedType.
#12: ResolvedType now implements `java.lang.reflect.Type`

 (suggested by Yuri S)
#8: Add additional pass-through methods in RawMember for all modifiers
 (requested by Phillip S)
